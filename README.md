In this code, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis using various visualization techniques including bar graphs, line charts, pie diagram and heatmap for checking correlation.
Also, tried to model the data using linear regression and printed the errors.
Still working on this dataset, and trying to model tha data using other algorithms.
The aim is to predict user raing of a book.
